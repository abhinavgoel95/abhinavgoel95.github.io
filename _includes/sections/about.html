    The ability to perform large scale computing on the cloud is fantastic. However, as the amount of data that needs to processed increases - the performance of these massive, centralized compute systems will soon get throttled by the laws of physics. I believe that real-time AI applications can not wait for data to be beamed out to large data centers, located miles away. Furthermore, as data-collecting sensors become more far-reaching - a truly autonomous and intelligent future needs AI computation to migrate to the edge. <br> </br>
    With a strong background in programming, I use my knowledge in computer engineering to find novel techniques to make the latest AI algorithms more deployable on edge devices.
